# Wackathon2023


Our Wackathon 2023 project :D

Our project is composed of two key features:

1. The grocerEasy desktop app
* The app allows a user to pick the items they would like to purchase at their next shopping trip.
* They can also select a time slot for their next trip.
* The app is compatible with screen readers
* The app uses a colour palette which remains contrasting for people with many types of colour blindness

2. The Technology for Easy Retail Inteface (TERI)
* TERI is our embedded system. It is a small device which leads the visually impaired person round a shop using audio cues.
* TERI's buzzer goes off when the user approaches an item on their list. TERI uses an RFID scanner and tags to detect the items.
